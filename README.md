# CITE Application

A single-page browser application for exploring citable resources, written in [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

## Current version: 1.4.2

See [release notes](releases.md).

## License

[GPL 3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

CITE Application, by default, downloads a sample corpus of texts. Licensing and attribution for those texts is available in the [downloads directory](downloads).

## Using

CITE Application is a single web page you can open in a browser. Precompiled versions are available in the [downloads directory](downloads), and named `cite-VERSION.html`.

## Building

CITE Application is targetted for Scala 2.12.You can use normal `sbt` using normal tasks for [ScalaJS projects](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/building.html) such as  `sbt fastOptJS` or `sbt fullOptJS`.

If `sbt fastOptJS` completes successfully, run the app by opening `CITE-App/target/scala-2.12/classes/index-dev.html` in your browser.

If `sbt fullOptJS` completes successfully, run the app by opening `CITE-App/target/scala-2.12/classes/index-opt.html` in your browser.

In addition, the project defines a custom `spa` task that builds a single-page application named `cite-VERSION.html` (where `VERSION` is the current version defined in `build.sbt`), in the `downloads` directory.

If `sbt fastOptJS` completes successfully, run the app by opening `CITE-App/target/scala-2.12/classes/index-dev.html` in your browser.

If `sbt fullOptJS` completes successfully, run the app by opening `CITE-App/target/scala-2.12/classes/index-opt.html` in your browser.

## Images for CiteApp

Documentation for configuring collections of images for CiteApp is underway at <https://github.com/cite-architecture/CITE-image-configurations>.

## Python SimpleServer

Running CiteApp locally, and attempting to access images, can run afoul of the Cross-Origin-Restrictions (CORS). It may be possible to tell your browser to ignore that security precaution. Or, a safer alternative, is to serve CiteApp locally. If Python is installed, navigate to the directory that contains `cite-VERSION.html`, and execute:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
