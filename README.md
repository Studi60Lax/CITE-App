## Building, testing

CITE Application is targetted for Scala 2.11.You can use normal `sbt` using normal tasks for [ScalaJS projects](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/project/building.html) such as  `sbt fastOptJS` or `sbt fullOptJS`.

In addition, the project defines a custom `spa` task that builds a single-page application named `cite-VERSION.html` (where `VERSION` is the current version defined in `build.sbt`), in the `downloads` directory.
